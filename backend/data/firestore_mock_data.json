I ask her what was wrong and she replied: I hear voices in my ears but I dont see the people saying it. She says it happened during school doing a reading circle. She thought someone called her stupid and let the teacher know. The teacher said no one said anything. It happened again when my husband was talking to my other children, she said I heard daddy say shut up, but he didnt really say it. The voice are always fimilar (someone she knows) Im very concerned about this and hope it has nothing to do with my pregnancy while on active duty.",

They come on suddenly and with absolutely no triggers whatsoever, although for hours to days before they happen I\u2019ll sometimes have uncomfortably high levels of energy\u2013I\u2019ll feel either obnoxious and silly (but in a kind of desperate way, if that makes sense) or I\u2019ll be really productive and jittery. Both of these high energy feelings are unsettling, maybe because I normally almost never have high levels of energy. The \u201cspells,\u201d \u201cepisodes,\u201d whatever they are, involve extreme guilt and disgust with myself\u2013but it\u2019s a very visceral feeling and it\u2019s overwhelming. I feel trapped inside my disgusting self and like I\u2019m willing to do anything to escape it. I feel incredibly agitated and yet trapped at the same time\u2013like I want to move or do something but I can\u2019t. I also just feel extremely empty and sad\u2013like, I\u2019m filled with this overwhelming emotion but other than that I\u2019m hollow. I feel so desperate and so unhappy and sick and like I hate myself so much\u2013but it\u2019s such a powerful physical feeling that it\u2019s hard to describe with words because it\u2019s a feeling and not a thought. I sob uncontrollably during these episodes (they usually last a few hours although they occasionally last longer) I\u2019ve definitely been suicidal during these periods, but it\u2019s not so much a conscious desire to kill myself than it is a need to escape how I\u2019m feeling. I\u2019m just afraid sometimes that since I\u2019m not really thinking during these times that I might do something to myself\u2013especially since I think during these times that I don\u2019t deserve to get help or that I\u2019m not worth disturbing people by calling them.",

Also he has lied to me during this time, first once he went to a party and when I asked him if he did he lied to me in my face. What bothered me was the fact that he had pictures dancing, almost rubbing himself, with another girl. He lied in my face when I asked! After that we had trust issues and I told him that he would need to help me out to solve that and he said yeah, he would make me trust him again. Months later I found out he is talking to a girl over the internet and he even met her and when I asked him if he knew her he said no again, lie to me in my face looking at my eyes. After that he went away in a trip and disappear for the whole trip without trying to reach me and also told me that his phone didn\u2019t have coverage there, that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t take it\u2026(another lie!) after all that I broke up with him\u2026I think he doesn\u2019t respect me because he is always adding girls on myspace and trying to meet girls\u2026we meet 5 months after we broke up and now he is asking me for a second chance\u2026we had sex once after the breakup, I think he only looks for me whenever he wants to have sex\u2026I still have feelings for him that\u2019s why I always end up accepting whatever he says but I know it is not good\u2026 What do I do? Should I give him a second chance or just forget about him? He says he is gonna make it up, that he has change an that now he is more mature but he had lied and hurt me so much that I feel that I love him but I have some anger towards him for making me cry so many times\u2026.why do I keep getting back with him every time he does something that hurts me? I Feel that I can get someone better, someone that would make me happy and don\u2019t hurt me that much\u2026but I don\u2019t know why I keep going back with him.",

I was very depressed because my dad was my hero and I blamed my mom for everything that went wrong.

I started self harming for about six months until my mom found out and suggested an inpatient program at a hospital. I refused to go because I didn\u2019t know if it was going to go on my record which could possibly affect my dreams of becoming a psychiatrist. So, instead she sent me to a councelor who I\u2019ve been seeing for about a year now. She sent me to a psychiatrist when I first started going to her and I was diagnosed with depression and put on medication but I stopped taking it a month after it was perscribed. I have a major fear of choking and drowning As well and can\u2019t swallow pills. I\u2019m still having major problems with the depression And My anxiety has been very bad, I\u2019ve been considering talking to my parents about finishing the year by taking online classes. Because I need to get away. But what I really want to know is, how can I deal with depression and dig myself out of this hole? It seems like everytime I get so close of beating in, I get nocked right back down to the bottom. I\u2019m still seeing my therapist but it\u2019s not enough, my mom is still pushing me to go back on medication but doesn\u2019t understand my fears. Is it even possible to beat this without medication? I also apologize if a lot of this doesn\u2019t make sense.",

His mother began emailing jokes to my fianc\u00e9 and me and we noticed that there were a couple other people on the emails including an ex girlfriend, who he dated for a short period of time. My fianc\u00e9 asked his mother if she was still in contact with her and she said yes that they email occasionally. He told her that it made him uncomfortable and thought that it was disrespectful to both he and I and that it would hurt my feelings. She responded very harshly by saying she wouldn\u2019t be told who she could talk to. And that if I was that fragile than she would never be close to me any way because she would not want to have a relationship with someone that she needs to sensor what she says because of my feelings. She then deleted me from her email contacts and kept the ex. She said that she would also be a friend with another ex-gf, who had been very rude and nasty to me early on in our relationship, if she was given the chance. I felt like the response was totally irrational, mean and disrespectful. I felt extremely hurt. Her response hurt even more than the actual emailing itself. I had always been very nice and respectful of his mother. My fianc\u00e9 has been very supportive and says that he would feel just as hurt and uncomfortable if the tables were turned and it were my mother behaving in this manner. All we wanted was for some respect for our feelings. It hurt to see this relationship flaunted in front of me and then to have my future mother in-law blatantly not care less about our feelings and choose to maintain a relationship with the ex and not her future daughter in-law.

He is now in his late fifties and he is beyond caring for himself. The last 4 or 5 living situations he was in (apartments) he was evicted for strange behavior like melting cassette tapes in the oven and starting a minor fire and bothering neighbors , including many other things. He stopped with all hygeine practices. He stopped being able to pay bills do to poor money mangement and lack there of. So he squatted with a few friends all of whom eventually sent him packing not at first realizing the extent of his illness. So after every fallout with his friends whom he has been staying with he ends up at my door with a police escort after they find him wandering the cold streets late at night. I live in a 1 bdrm apartment with my girlfriend and two large dogs. I am not equipped to deal with another person in such confined quarters let alone his illness. As you probably have guessed he refuses medication as well as his illness. He has other health issues that I know nothing about and he will not see a doctor, especially with me present. He has a ventalin inhaler that is prescribed to him that he uses way more than he was origanally suppossed to , along with smoking two + packs of cigarettes a day. He can barely walk ten steps without being seriously out of breath. My father needs help that I can\u2019t give him and all the calls I\u2019ve made trying to find help has come to the same roadblock. Someone can\u2019t be forced treatment. I don\u2019t know what to do. This has been going on for years. This is Saturday and he came via police escort Thursday night just before midnight. I had to call off work Friday because I can\u2019t leave him alone at my apartment in fear he will do something and get me evicted, or worse. I\u2019m at the end of my ropes and don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t just send him out on the streets but it is affecting my happiness and comfort in my home which is very important to me. My girlfriend is supportive about it but it has already caused a strain. Sorry for the lengthy note but I really don\u2019t feel like I even grazed the surface. If there is anyway you can help with resources or ideas it would mean the world to me. Thank you.",

                    "post_content": " My husband and I have been together for almost 10 years and have one child. We are very openminded and compatible sexually, though our sex life has been through some ups and downs as we have grown as people and experienced child birth and child rearing. The first few years of our relationship, we did some wild things sexually, such as public sex, group sex, voyeurism, etc. We both enjoyed ourselves and were equally involved and responsible for our actions. During and after the pregnancy and birth of our child, however, our sex life went through some drastic changes, and we found ourselves with some sexual issues to work through. One of these issues was my newfound disinterest in our old wild ways; motherhood had turned my viewpoint on it from fun to irresponsible. We have gotten over most of the awkwardness that made its way into our bed, but now we are presented with a somewhat \u201egray area\u2030 issue. Over the past year or so, my husband has been visiting sexual video chat sites and broadcasting himself in various sexual states, most of the time masturbating, in both public and private online communications. At first he did this secretly, until I found out in a very startling way; I investigated the website that kept appearing in our computer\u201as browser history on my phone at work, and was shocked to find a live public video feed of my husband fully aroused. After some obvious conflict over the discovery, we discussed it, and he told me that he missed having our \u201ewild sex life\u2030 and that this helps fulfill that need. He asked if I would participate, and I agreed in hopes of helping to satisfy his sexual mentality. We broadcast ourselves having sex online a few times, having up to 1000 people watch, which completely turned my husband on and completely turned me off. I decided I wasn\u201at going to join him again due to the uneasy feeling it gave me which kept me from enjoying myself. Ever since, I have known in the back of my mind that he still does this, and have gotten up in the middle of the night a few times to find him masturbating and video chatting publicly or with females who are at least scantily clad, if not nude and masturbating themselves. When I confront him about it, he says he has a public sex fetish and needs to fulfill it, believing that it helps keep him \u201efaithful\u2030 to me since I am no longer interested. (Something you should know about my husband; he is a popular musician and is often confronted with opportunities for sex at shows, but I am confident that he hasn\u201at cheated on me). It is obviously a disturbing experience to get up and find him doing this, and although he is not physically cheating, I still feel hurt and disrespected on these occasions. I basically want an outsider\u201as point of view on whether I should accept this as part of the man I fell in love with and married, reject it on the grounds of how I feel (although I have a hard time with the thought of leaving him over it), or if we should try to work out some sort of compromise. I would like to come up with some way where he can feel fulfilled and I can be a part of it, without making me uncomfortable, but haven\u2019t been able to (not asking you to figure out what that would be for me, just mentioning it). Thank you very much for your time and help with this issue.",

Both my girlfriend and me are 20 years of age. We have been together since July 2nd 2010, and it is March 28th 2011. We were friends for many years before we started dating but due to both of us moving around we were not able to have a relationship. She is everything I ever wanted in a woman and I am so happy to have her in my life. I had no sexual interactions what so ever before I was with her, she is my first in everything. Unfortunately, I am not her first in many things, if anything at all, and that is very hurtful and distressing to me. When she was growing up her parents neglected and even abused her. She was molested on several occasions, but never by a family member. Her life has not been one of happiness and is full of past pains that plague her to this day. She never felt loved or cared about by anyone, and sought out relationships to fill this void. Her first sexual experience was with a female, they were friends and one night during a sleep over her friend put her hand down my girlfriends pants and began feeling around down there. My girlfriend said she did it back to her friend. She was bisexual for a while and dated a few girls, but never did anything for that kiss them. Though not often she claims. Her first sexual experience with a boyfriend was when she was 14 and the guy she was dating asked her to \u201ctouch him\u201d, and so she did. She says she didn\u2019t want to but did it to make him happy. In her next relationship she let him suck on her breasts and finger her, she touched him but while he had pants on so there was no contact with his penis. In her third relationship she also let him finger her and she gave him a hand job as well. In her last relationship she went out with this guy for 2.5 years and she really loved him. He was the first she gave oral sex to, and they did everything together. He fingered her; she gave him many hand jobs and lots of oral sex. She wanted to have sex and so did he, but she brought it up to him. They agreed and she claims that he only penetrated her a little bit before finishing, so she doesn\u2019t believe she lost her virginity. He claims that every time they tried, which both him and her say was 3 times, that they had full intercourse but she swears that after that first time having failed, and the other two times they never got past being naked, none of the times they ever had full intercourse. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s trying to protect me because she knows how bad it would hurt me if they actually did, or if she really didn\u2019t have full on sex with him. I know her was able to penetrate her at least somewhat so I also have issues with whether she was still a virgin the first time we had sex.",

I feel like he has split personalities. Many times he doesn\u2019t remember tasks he completed days ago. We are at a stressful time in our relationship which includes the 6 month old baby. We used to be best friends and still today sometimes we enjoy time shared with the baby, but I see more and more he has no idea of what I\u2019m referring to because he asks, \u201chuh?\u201d all the time. There has been lingering problems. About two years ago he was photographed in an almost orgy like sexual setting. However, he still insists and believes I (age 23) am the only girl he has ever kissed or hugged despite the pictures. It gets worst. There is another female who claims to have had a yearlong relationship with him that resulted in a baby! I believe her, and her child is two months older than mine. When I ask him he has no idea who the person is. I have even talked to the ex-girlfriend and one phone partner without his knowledge. He really thinks our relationship is fine. He loves our son and would do anything to take care of him, and he is happy to celebrate our would be 7 year boyfriend girlfriend relationship. He calls us his \u201cfamily\u201d and asks for us soon as he comes home from work. When I threaten to leave him he cries about how lonely he is and that he wants to kill himself. But, I still find him secretly texting girls on the phone that are listed under boy names. I really don\u2019t understand any of this and I\u2019m falling deeply into depression myself that along with the baby weight I can\u2019t shed. If I ask him for the truth he will simply look me in the face and tell another lie. {I can\u2019t bear it, seriously.}",

My anxiety used to be worse a couple of years ago, but now im just paranoid. Im always thinking that people think im a loser, and I wont leave the house without makeup, because i am horrified about what other people think about me.",

Up until recently I\u2019ve been very suspicious and my trust just keeps going down. I started to lose trust when finding a text message in his phone from someone calling him \u201cbabe\u201d on Valentines Day. He said it was nothing like that, and I asked to see the rest of the messages from that person but he said no because he thought that would change the dynamics of our relationship and that I am supposed to just trust him, so I let it go. Ever since that occasion it\u2019s been so hard for me to trust him like I did in the beginning. He\u2019s constantly texting some person in his phone and I\u2019m 99% sure it is a female, which does not bother me. But what does bother me is that for some reason I have this gut instinct that this female he is constantly texting is someone he is involved with. When I sit and ponder on that idea I think to myself, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even have time to spend with other women, he\u2019s always so busy.\u201d But I almost feel like I\u2019m convincing myself because I just have this feeling inside. On top of all of this my mother and a few of my close friends don\u2019t really trust this guy or particularly care for him too which makes it even harder for me as well. I\u2019m wondering how you feel about this situation? Should I end this relationship before I get hurt or wait it out and see if it can really become as good as I thought it could?",

But recently they\u2019ve been happening more and more frequently and I\u2019ve been getting more and more angry each time. Each argument has been about the same major topics: my behavior towards my siblings or how I \u201cdisrespect\u201d my parents. But sometimes I can\u2019t help what I say to my parents. If they\u2019re in my face yelling about what I just said or how I forgot to do something, how can I not yell back? My parents say its disrespect, but I feel that they have no respect for me when they\u2019re yelling in my face. But the topic we argue most about is my little brother. He\u2019s 7 and if I do the slightest thing to him he goes and tells and I get the whole \u201cyou\u2019re older and need to grow up speech\u201d. I\u2019m sick of it. I feel that they can\u2019t see that my little brother does things that really bother me, and I\u2019m not being dramatic. Like today, my little brother does this thing where he just touches me. I HATE when he does this because it\u2019s COMPLETELY unnecessary. So I hit him back, not that hard just a slap in the arm. Just so happens my dad was walking by at the same exact time. When he saw this he immediately got in my face, hit my arm (and I had to fight back the urge to hit my dad right back), and started giving me a speech (which during I was completely being a smart aleck because I felt this whole thing was not my fault). When my mother got home I got the same speech from her, but she just didn\u2019t understand how I felt! Then while I was in the room right next to the kitchen they started to discuss what they should do to that \u201cdevil\u201d. But my defense is that my little brother is just very dumb and a wimp and that my parents baby him too much. But to avoid these confrontations I feel the only way to do this is to COMPLETELY IGNORE my whole family. I\u2019ve been doing this by sleeping all day and my schoolwork is suffering, I also barely eat because of sleeping all day. But these arguments always seem to find their way into my life. Is there any way to get my parents to understand me? How do I deal with 7-year-old brother? Can I just keep ignoring them? Please do not treat his as a teenager being dramatic, this is a serious cry for help. After some of these arguments I\u2019ve hurt myself. I scratched my arm with tweezers and today I dug my own nails into my arm. Some of these arguments have resulted in me almost getting smacked in the face by my dad. I\u2019ve also cried for hours before. So please I\u2019m begging for help.",

A week later we tried to get a mortgage on a home and found out that he has something in collection. So I suggested taking line of credit out in my name to bye off the collection. So next here we could then purchase a home and get married. Aug 2 he left for a 10-week course. In the 10 weeks he would only call once a week and he allowed the truck to bounce twice (I first figure the way his pay was going in and the way the payments were going out there wasn\u2019t enough money (2 pays 3 payment in aug.) I didn\u2019t get mad I went up and deposited $1000 to cover it. Once there I found out that he didn\u2019t transfer anymore. I fly down to watch him graduate and see my friends (I was from there) and drive back with him. The trip sucked he wasn\u2019t interested in me based on his saying, attitude and he stated drinking. I tried to talk to him and I was given the cold shoulder. Home (we don\u2019t live together yet) My gut was telling me something was wrong so I decided knowing his password went on because I was concern about his drinking (recovering addict) if I could find something that would help me. Instead I found an email to the girl on course. I asked him about her and said I know because I read the email. He got mad at me saying he can\u2019t trust me and walked out the door. I want to talk find out if it do to drinking, was it an emotional or physical affair. He tells me they were set up emails, and I am a fool and break off our engagement. I told him if we are not emotional together then we will not be financially together and I made him get his parents to co-sign a loan to buy the truck from me. He says he will continue making the line of credit payments. I want to believe him but I have a feeling I will have to take him to small claims court for this.",

I always feel like people talk about me and hav had suicidal thouts before. Plz help me because I\u2019ve tried talking to my family but they won\u2019t listen!",

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "Journal Entry: My best friend and I are very different from each other but we have grown a very strong relationship over the years. She is a smart, highly educated, 32 year old virgin that I hardly think has ever even kissed someone. Myself, I have been in many relationships but am currently single, 32 years old as well. My friend has been growing as a person a lot over the last year, and in August she came to me and said she´d started dating someone she met online. I was very supportive that she started online dating, and thrilled that she wanted to go out for drinks, buy shoes with high heals, and I encouraged more social behaviour. She dated this guy for a few weeks and it ended. Then, about 6 weeks ago she called me at 00.30 on a Thursday night, asking if she could come over because she had something to tell me. I got a bit stressed thinking it must be serious, because it was so late, and because it could not wait. She told me that when she started dating that online-guy they had sex. He was her first, and they were not in love. Then she told me that she liked it rough and he could not give her what she wanted. She had therefore joined a sadomasochistic sex society, went to an information meeting and now attends meetings and parties. This just after having sex for the first time a few weeks earlier. She told me she didn’t want to lie to me and wanted me to know what was going on, because we are so close and I know everything that is going on in her life. This particular night she came straight from a 45-year-old man she had had sex with. My friend and I have hardly ever talked about sex, I have even wondered that she might be a lesbian without knowing it herself yet. I was shocked to say the least. We live in a small city with 300 000 inhabitants, big enough to be anonymous, but still. I want her to experience love and sex, not sex as a mechanistic act. The days after her confession I felt confused and sad, kind of like I’m losing her. Now she has a complete new side to her life that I cant share with her, and she has met so many new people. People of all sorts with a variety of sex-interests, some living in polygamist relationships. A lot that is new to me, but I wish to be open-minded. One week after the breaking news she attended a party and met a guy wearing latex clothes. Lets call him Alan. They jumped straight into a relationship, and one week after they first met, Alan and his friend joined my friend and I at a cabin trip (because he was going to Kuala Lumpur in a few days for work). He was rude to me and I did not like his attitude. He seems very emotionally unstable (I have a PhD in neuroscience), and recently got out of a 6-year relationship, just 2 months prior. He kept talking about his ex and how she being mentally ill had ruined their relationship. Apparently this ex-girlfriend grew up in several foster homes and was sexually abused, married a 25-year-older man that she left – including the children because she was an unfit mother. Later on it was revealed that this old father had abused the children too, and she got the custody back. Then she met Alan. Alan is dominant and my best friend likes to be dominated, apparently. I cant help but think that Alan sort of “liked” being with a damaged woman that he could help and further dominate. I don’t know, but it bothers me how negatively he was talking about her. All matters have two sides. Now my friend talks about Alan constantly and is in love. She has already introduced him to her parents and some of our other friends. After only 5 weeks acquaintance. She really wants me to like him. However, I find it really hard to like him and her new lifestyle. I feel like I have lost her and that our friendship has changed forever. It makes me really sad, she has been such an important part of my life for so long. I feel like she has put a lot on me, the sex-club in itself will take some time to accept. However, introducing a man to me just a few days after the confession and expecting me to like him, is just too much. How should I react to this? I am trying to be happy for her, but in a way I don’t want to. It’s quite possible that if I don’t like this new guy I will lose my best friend. Should I just move on and accept that we have become too different now? I would really appreciate some thoughts about this, I have no-one I can discuss it with.

Throughout my life until I left to college I used journals as a way to express my feelings. I grew up in a home where my father was verbally/emotionally/ and somewhat physically abusive and I was not allowed to have a voice so I would put all my feelings and thoughts in my journals.

She told me everyday if I kept being fat I’d get bullied and in my mind I always felt like she was my only bully.

While I do enjoy the intimacy of sex with my boyfriend despite this, I have never been able to achieve orgasm no matter what my partner tries to do or for how long. Even with assistance from vibrators it’s virtually impossible, and the only way I’ve managed to achieve orgasm is by my own intervention. I don’t understand why I have this issue, especially because I am very attracted to him. My boyfriend doesn’t complain to me about it or anything like that, but I can tell that it makes him feel self-conscious. I’ve tried explaining to him that it’s not his fault at all, but I worry that he still feels like he’s inadequate. What should I do?\nAnalyze the text for cognitive distortions.

It usually revolves around me being too quiet. The first time we were in the car and he started yelling at me for being too quiet, I then got even more quiet as I’ve been in an emotionally and physically abusive relationship before (and that used to be the safest reaction) and then he started calling me names. I then had a panic attack, as I suffer from anxiety. Prior to meeting him, I hadn’t had an attack for a year. He always calls me names when he’s angry, and then when he’s calmed down he apologizes and says he’s sorry he’s been a dick, but he loves me, and I just need to give him time to get used to me.

But I don’t get heard. At work I don’t get taken seriously by a colleague I work with on a joint project, my asserted work needs & suggestions get ignored.

I wasn’t employed to do full time admin but in a skilled role needing qualifications. I’ve done work I’ve been given well & enthusiastically.

I coordinate a group, we meet to agree on dates & events for the year. At times have people cancel at the last minute meaning an event has been cancelled. I’ve face to face & via email asked that they advise they can’t come as soon as they know so that as much notice of an event cancellation can be given to give the 1-2 who can make it time to make other arrangements & avoid last minute disappointment. I’ve phrased this by giving the facts, acknowledging things come up but to advise ASAP, the impact of last minute event cancellations on others especially hosts but there are still last minute cancellations. I’d suggested people feel free to arrange additional impromptu events but said if someone were to do so please RSVP quickly either way otherwise no one will want to organize anything if no one responds.

I fantasize about torturing them in the worst possible ways i can come up with, then slowly kill them while they watch me doing it. I don’t know if the thoughts have anything to do with schizophrenia, since i had those thoughts for a long time. All i want to know is how to control those thoughts, since i start feeling like someday i could do that without thinking, as an impulse.

It’s a long story, but he had a very rough childhood because of his parents’ choices. She acts like mom-of-the-year, while I am stuck trying to work through my husband’s and my problems without losing my sanity. How can I make her understand that a) she’s not helping, b) her son really DOES have a problem (beyond his depression), and c) that it’s serious, and not something to brush off?

He tells me all the time it’s his mother’s fault for his problems and how she makes things worse, but of course he would never tell her that. So she gets to continue thinking she has nothing to do with his problems because it’s only me who he treats this way. I will also add that we have all been to see a therapist.

I have difficulty regulating my emotions. They are rarely, not, intense and sustained. They are triggered almost always by internal/external stimulants. 2. Since as far as I can remember(5 years old), to being 20 years of age – I was generally in a mania state/mood.

He was late from work or school, didn’t text or respond to texts or calls. Then he just wouldn’t come home until next day and wouldn’t say or would just say be home late and ignore any follow-up question. After the first few times, he explained that he was bored or unhappy and it just built up until it was just exploding. I told him that he could spend time with friends but he should have respect for me and keep me updated. After that he proceeded to stay away for 5 days, texting me daily that he would be home that night. He even apologized and proceeded to stay away another two days. He eventually came home but now we are in another week+ period. There has been no real explanation other than saying he is having fun, just an unreliable person, he wants to make sure it is clear in his mind before he explains it, and it has to do with us. The behavior has been extremely cruel, not explaining what is wrong and just giving the silent treatment. I could never imagine doing that to someone I love. He has done similar things in past but were not living together – they involved silent treatment that lasted a week until I could get him to explain – usually some kind of perceived idea about how I will react to something. He does not really communicate his feelings. He does not take criticism well. He makes few decisions and procrastinates. He is always late. He shows no anger. I asked him to go to our PCP but told him just a checkup re potential depression. He agreed, came home and he went to do laundry and never came back – without a coat in cold, later texting he felt I was pushing/controlling him. He said the problem was us-me (no detail) and cancel the appt. We are now at the point where he says he loves and misses me but is not ready to come home.

For quite a while now I have been experiencing extremely intense mood swings and identity shifts that only last for a very short period of time. One minute I can feel suicidal, the next I feel euphoric, the next I am bursting with energy, the next I am rage full, and the next I feel like a rational human being. However, I have found that when I’m in these euphoric, energetic moods I can become extremely paranoid if triggered. The other night I slept over at my friend’s house in one of these moods, and the voices inside of my head said that if I didn’t throw my phone at the wall, something horrible would happen. So I struggled with it for a while, and then finally threw my phone at the wall. All my friends who were trying to go to sleep woke up. These voices are not audible they are just two voices that seem to be there and tell me to do things, but they contradict one another all the time, and often I can’t figure out who to trust. I’ve felt pretty stable for a little over a week now, except for last night when I thought that my mother was trying to poison me (lately I’ve been feeling more and more that my parents are trying to kill me). I had a small panic attack and then I got over it. I also started planning out how to kill my friend, but then changed my mind. I become very angry and murderous at times but still seem to have a capacity for intense empathy for others. The confusing thing is, whenever I switch back into my rational mode I view my past actions as ridiculous and try to forget about them. Rational mode can last for a week or so, maybe longer, and then I go back headlong into a tailspin and let everything fall apart. I know that I am not schizophrenic because these voices are not audible and I still have a pretty good grip on reality. I also know that it is not bipolar disorder because the moods change far too quickly. I am very confused, and would appreciate a little guidance.

There , she was unable to adjust because of a sort of phobia of flesh and dead bodies( which were included in anatomy dissections ),watching deliveries worsened her condition leading to a decision of abandoning the medical studies. She graduated privately and joined the teaching profession. She had always been an aggressive person .She was also very arrogant as “she was a perfect beauty with brains” women. Finding out about painless delivery she agreed to get married .She married my father( it was an arranged one).She has revolting point of views about religion, and lives in her own fantasy world .She sort of thinks that every man is after her. She also thinks that people are conspiring against her. She hates her her mother and her brothers .She has been receiving treatment from various psychiatrists but nothing has helped much.She is currently in an institution called Fountain house. But she does not cooperate much with her therapists as she thinks that she is much more intelligent than them.She does not accept her disease and thinks she has Insomia only. Another thing is that she cannot sleep for more than 3 hours a night without medicines. Presently she is taking 5 anti- psychotics .The names and doses are listed below: ziapine 100 mg 4 daily seductil 100 2 daily Ativan 2 daily Neurolith 1 daily Dosik 5 mg 1 daily Kempro 5 mg 2 daily Clonatril 2 mg 1 daily Injections ( fortnightly) Zyclidine 10 mg Fluefin Please do not disappoint me. I am myself a medical student and an only child .Dealing with my mother becomes very challenging as she is very very aggressive at times. Thanking you.\nAnalyze the text for cognitive distortions.

I started having anxiety when my girlfriend (soon to be wife) got pregnant while we were in high school. I finally broke down and asked my mom for help and we went and seen a psychologist. He told me all i had was anxiety and no disorder. I have noticed that I obsess with things. When i was younger i use to have a fear of hiv/aids. (i was not educated on it very well is why i figure i had a fear of it). I have noticed i obsess with 1 topic for a few months then once i start getting anxiety again from life i swap subjects maybe for a relief of some kind? (For instance for a few months ill be really into fishing and want to know all the best stuff then ill swap to trucks and ect.) This causes me no distress really. My distress comes from when i start getting scared im going schizo. This is the only mental illness that i really obsess over. There is no mental in my family except my mom which has depression. I obsess over it so much ill think i hear voices. It says what im feeling deep down like the one of the times i was thinking about a dirtbike and was obsessing over the parts and what id do to it kind of zoning everything out.

I work full-time and I guess I started to be jealous of his schedule, being able to be home, etc. Since he had so much time, he started to play computer games again (used to play them 24/7 as a teenager) which also included joining some online forums. In July I discovered that he was talking to multiple girls online (sexually and romantically) and that he joined forums such “looking for relationship” etc. He told me he had only talked to one girl (I saw conversations with multiple women) and only because she had mental issues. After that, he stopped talking to them online, yet still kept playing video games. He was supposed to find a new job since his PT job slowly stopped making him any money, yet he wasn’t able to (or didn’t even try) find one within the past 6-7months. He plays his computer games around 10 hours a day, goes to bed at 3-5am pretty much every day, spends money (that I’m trying to save) on his games and ignores everything around the house. Whenever I try to confront him about something he gets very upset, calls me names like “b*tch” “idiot” and just yells at me. Whenever I find out he lied to me about something it’s the same – starts to yell at me, starts to throw things, hit himself, calls me names and sometimes blames it on me. Then he always apologizes and tells me how much he loves me and that I’m his everything. Now he is supposed to go back to school starting in two weeks, but every time I asked him to show me his log in, schedule or just something, he gets upset and his log in magically doesn’t work.I looked at his school email and saw many emails from his school counselors telling him that he was late to sign up and can only sign up for summer semester at this point.

I have never though much about until here of late. It all centers around a place that me and my family stayed. It was a duplex and I don’t remember living there at all. I remember that house before that and the one after. The first memory I have of the house we lived in after the duplex is me and my older brother “exploring ourselves”. It was more then a “you show me yours and I’ll show you mine.” I feel so ashamed about that and cannot figure out for the life of me WHY we did that?? I can remember touching my stuffed animals in inappropriate places and even doing the same things with another girl that was my age. I started having sex at a very early age, around 12, and haven’t stopped since. In fact, that is really the only risk taking behavior I have ever really had. From somewhere, and I don’t know where, it has been imprinted on my mind that if you care someone, that’s how you show it. I have never had any other experiences with my brother since that very young age, but I know that we did it more then once. I am just wondering were all this was coming from. I recently started having dreams of my brother and me now. I know, it sounds sick, but I can’t help it. This is also something that we have never talked about since it happened. I have also been having like these flashbacks of this man that used to come to the house that I don’t remember living in. (I know he was there from what my brothers have told me) In the scenarios, I am a little girl, around 5,6 or 7. I am yelling for my daddy, (my parents were separated at the time we lived in this house also) and a man in a police uniform, tucking me into bed and telling me to quit yelling and the he loved me and putting his hand over my mouth. I started to investigate this man and he was arrested in 2001 for 7 counts of indecent liberties with a minor spanning from 1976 to 2001. The accusers were girls that he babysat for other women and his daughter. I am just wondering if maybe my mind has blocked out the span of those years for a reason. Is that possible?? Is that why me and brother were “exploring” each other?? It would in fact explain a lot of my behavior. I have anxiety issues now, but I to scared to see a therapist. I am getting married in May and I am scared that if this comes out, he will think differently of me because of what occurred with one of my brothers??

But occasionally when I get angry I lash out physically, so I’ll hit walls or pull on my hair but I’ve never hurt anyone and it’s always been in private so no one knows this has been happening. About a month ago my girlfriend told me something that made me angry. I could feel myself getting angry and started to pace around her room, she could she I was distressed and got up to comfort me but in that moment I needed space so I pushed her away onto her bed. She wasn’t hurt she was just shocked. I hadn’t even realised I’d done it. Anyway I calmed down in the end and we’ve carried on as normal. But recently we spoke about the incident again and she told me that she’s now constantly afraid to get me angry in fear that I might hurt her or go further than just pushing her away. I love her and she’s the last person I want to hurt and it kills me that I’ve given her a reason to think these things. I just wanted to ask the question here firstly to see if you think this is a serious anger issue that would benefit from speaking to a therapist or going on a course or something. And if there’s anything I can do in the meantime to make things better. Maybe techniques that can calm me down. I genuinely don’t think I could ever hurt her, she is the most important thing in the world to me. But it scares me that I didn’t realise I had pushed her. All I want is to be someone that she feels safe around and to be the best I can be for her. Any help of advice would be much appreciated.

(I also remember earlier she has told me that she has to buy these, and I’m not sure if she mentioned that sb asked her to buy them for him/her or not) When packing, she also kept the store’s bag. and that was when I remembered she didn’t want her colleagues to know she was on a trip. The paranoia started. It couldn’t be for the colleagues. All of the terrible feelings from last year came rushing to my head. Does she have a secret friend? She didn’t buy anything worthy (but she did buy some expensive gifts for my father) but the idea of my mom buying a gift for a man had made me desperate since we’re back. I also suffer from anxiety and in the last year and 2 years ago I’ve became really paranoid, about being pregnant without penetration, about my boyfriend cheating and about my mom cheating, and all were false. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I’m right about being paranoid and should do something about my mom, or I’m sick. Please help me.\nAnalyze the text for cognitive distortions.

I tend to get different ideas or incorrect information from what people are explaining to me, or it just takes me a long time to process the information that is given to me. This causes me to come off as stupid, or makes me seem that I don’t care.

I feel this is the right thing to do, but I always feel like I’ve don’t something wrong when I express this to my friends or co-workers. Growing up I always felt like I was an intelligent person. I never really thought like a child and was always more aware of myself and how my actions affected those around me than most other children. I love learning, but can’t seem to understand what people are saying to me. I’ve always had this inner monologue that is either pushing me to do something I don’t want to do, or just telling me negative things about myself. I’ve actually caught myself sometimes arguing out loud with this voice. It was me speaking the whole time, but in two different tones. Also I tend to see really horrible images in my head. For example if I see a plane flying by I’ll see it blowing up right in front of my eyes. Or if I’m see a person walking down the street I’ll see them getting hit by a car. I don’t want these things to happen and it really upsets me when I see them to the point where I’ll sometimes start crying.

She also has a youtube channel where she explicates that her boyfriend, “daddy” is 10 years older than her, and they have been together for almost a year meaning she was a minor when they got together. She aspires to become a make up artists and have her own business and I am fearful that this will negatively damage her reputation. I am aware that both of these behaviours are types of sexual misconduct/disorders however when she was going though various mental situations a few years ago she completely refused help. I am very conflicted about how to handle the situation because I am assuming her parents don’t know, and her brother wants nothing to do with it but I feel like they should know. I am fearful for her safety in the short term and long term as well and was wondering how I should handle this situation. Do I confront her about her posting, tell her parents, or forget about it all together. (From Canada)\nAnalyze the text for cognitive distortions.

My younger sister has some major issues as well and is abusive to both me and my father. Despite this, he seems to prefer her more. He is a pretty unemotional man by nature, but he is always talking with her and they have a lot of fun. He mentors her gently and speaks very kindly to her. She’s very mean to him, telling him to go and kill himself and has physically attacked both of us in the past, but he still adores her. I’ve always tried to be a good kid and played mediator between my parents when they were divorcing. I’ve gotten good grades, helped around the house, and even got accepted into a top university with a generous grant. I’m not saying that that warrants affection, but my dad can’t stand to be around me. He’s always very critical and controlling of me, to the point where I’ve begun to develop an eating disorder. He never sees my accomplishments as accomplishments and instead tears down what I’ve done. He’s always pushing me away in favor of someone else. There are times when he’d rather be with his work buddies than with me. I try to joke with him, make him smile, make him things, and generally be the best daughter I can be, but I feel as if he just feels obligated to be around me because he’s my father, not because he loves me. I feel this is because I look very much like his ex-wife, my mother. Or maybe it’s for some other reason, I really don’t know. All I’ve ever really wanted in life is for him to have some pride in me. My father is someone I look up to a lot and who I love more than anything. I would do anything for him. My family is very small. All we have is each other.

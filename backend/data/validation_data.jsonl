I know he would physically abuse her, and I’m pretty sure he mentally abused her too. She always dismissed it saying that he was drunk, but I could tell she still resented him and was very scared of him. She assured me that he never really hit her anymore but recently she would come to school with cuts on her face. When I asked her about it all she said was that she had been missing school because she was sick and her stepdad hated when she missed school. I was immediately concerned and considered reporting it but I knew my friend was scared that if the abuse was reported that she would get taken away from her mom and have to live with her dad in Florida. She hates her dad so much that she would rather ive with her abusive stapdad and she insist that her real dad is not fit to take care of here. I know she trusts me not to report it and I know if I did she would feel betrayed and would probably never forgive me. I normally would talk to my mom about this whole situation but she is a teacher and therefore is a mandated reporter. I need help deciding what to do. I try to be there for her but I feel horrible letting the abuse happen. should i report it and hope that if she does get removed from the household that she would go live with another family, like her grandparents who live in the same town, or should I just continue to be there for my friend?\nAnalyze the text for cognitive distortions.

My partner is contradictory and critical, but at the same time gets very upset if any of her ideas or decisions are questioned in any way. Examples: She will ridicule any book I am reading unless it is one recommended by her. If it is not a subject that interests her, especially technical books, she will describe the book as childish rubbish. The same with any TV program or film. She is an aspirational vegetarian. If I have meat and she has vegetarian she has spent the evening — while I am eating — asking how I could eat dead rotting flesh, how do I feel having caused the death of  a living being just for my gratification etc. The following week she will buy, cook and eat chicken and say how tasty it is. Sex. This has now ceased. Very often she has not only rejected me, but says that I am disgusting for wanting sex, “Don’t come near me. Don’t you dare touch me”etc — almost hysterical. A couple of days later she will start crying and ask why don’t I make love to her any more, don’t I care for her? She will deny that she ever said that she did not want me near her. I thought that being nice to her would gain her trust and we would get closer. But it seems to have the opposite reaction. The nicer I am, the more awkward, contradictory and demanding she becomes. She seems to need to push me until we have a disagreement. My partner’s mother was English and her father Portuguese and she was brought up in Portugal. Her parents broke up when she was 10 and she ended up with her mother who did not spend much time with her as she had to work hard. With her job her mother was given a scholarship for her daughter to go to the local international school. My partner spent years there but never got on as her first language was not English. She felt very left out, not coming from a rich family. My partner has two older brothers and mentions her poor relationship with them when she was a child. They continually told her she was stupid and ugly. If she wore a new dress they would tease her mercilessly. I think this has had a big impact.

She also would not ask us for help directly, instead she would say something like ‘If only someone can help me do…’ or ‘We are eating so much today. There would be a lot of dishes to clean’ Most of the time my sisters and I would get the hint and help her around. However, sometimes we would think of it as just a casual statement and my mother would start throwing a huge tantrum. Furthermore, my mother is really insensitive or ignorant about our feelings. She would always call my sister and I fat when my sister and I are actually quite petite for our age. She would also go on a very strict diet and try to compete with us. Like if my sister or I lost any weight (not really on purpose), she would try to lose double of that. My mother would always stand in front of the mirror and just stare at it for a few minutes. Whenever I have any problems that i try to tell her, she would just brush it off or make everything about her. When i told her about some friendship problem i was having, she would be like ‘I had a lot of those when i was young…’ and end of with ‘You know, you’re exactly like me’ and im not trying to be offensive or anything, but i really don’t want to be like her. Even from when i was young, she was always very violent when she was angry and she would break a lot of furniture but i thought that this was a normal adult behavior. I’ve begun reading a lot of books about narcissist but I know its not good to diagnose her using these books. (From Singapore)\nAnalyze the text for cognitive distortions.

I finally went to a psychologist and psychiatrist when my life was falling apart. I felt awful and had felt awful for a very long time, but after getting on medications and feeling like a normal, happy person for a couple years, it all felt like an old unreal dream. So I decided to stop my medications. My doctors advised me against it, saying that if I had suffered more than 3 episodes, I should stay on medication indefinitely, but I had never “counted” my episodes. Really, it just felt like I was born with one long and nasty episode. I have been off my meds for a month now and I feel horrible. My anxiety is so bad that my whole body hurts from being so tense and shaky. I’m missing work either because I’m too busy crying or I just don’t want to deal with life. I feel lonely, sad, and hopeless. I feel like I am cursed for life. From what I have read and heard, depression occurs in episodes. But I feel like I am doomed to feel like this forever, having no respite unless I take high doses of medications. Is it possible that I just have a “lifetime long episode”? I only went to see a psychiatrist when I was 22, about a year after I moved out of my parents house. My parents are deniers of mental illness – the have a “pick yourself up by your bootstraps” / “you can’t possibly have depression” attitudes, so I always attributed my poor mental status to a character flaw. But when I reflect on my childhood and adolescence, I don’t ever remember being happy. I think I was always depressed. I cannot possibly live my life feeling this depressed but I don’t want to take medication for the rest of my life either. I haven’t even mentioned that my medications and behavioral therapies have done absolutely nothing to help my OCD. That I have heard can last a lifetime. I don’t think I can live like this.

For example, we attended an event in which I ran into a male who had caused a serious injury to myself in which I almost lost a leg.

The whole incident/my behavior last possibly 5 mins before I collected myself and went back to having a good time.

I’m too young to be worrying about my life the way I do. i have a very good body image and I try to keep it that way as best as i can. a little too much. I believe I suffer from Obsessive Compulsive Dissorder. I havent really been able to admit it to myself or anyone around me. I believe I’ve had it for maybe two years or so, but its gotten worse over time. It starts with waking up. If i dont sit up a certain way that doesnt make me comfortanle, I lay back down. I go down stairs to eat my breakfast. if i dont see something i like on TV i have to blink 10 times or until im confortable to get the image out of my mind. in school, i cant sit on chairs without whiping it off 5 times because if i dont, i think ill get fat. i can’t touch doorknobs because im afraid ill get sick from the germs. If i smell something bad, or something i dont like, i have to “push out” the bad scent out of my nose three times and breathe in “good smells” once or twice. My friends notice that I’ve been acting strange but i usually cover it up by saying like my nose itches or there were crumbs on the seat. Its really hard for me to live with and i am soo frustrated from it. Im only a sophmore in High School.

What im asking is to know that I’m not the only one whos going threw this or if I’ve diagnosed myself correctly. Ive researched it and all signs point to OCD.

I dont know if medication will help with these problems or if i need sleep or if its stress. I really need some advice because i hate living like this. Am I going crazy?

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "Journal Entry: Hi, In the past month my girlfriend experienced something strange four times. She was in a manipulative/emotionally abusive relationship that lasted 9 years, and ended recently. She’s been struggling because of it, and I’ve been helping her. She self-harmed, had suicidal thoughts, and attempted suicide. When things got overly stressful, she had anxiety attacks where she would convulse(?)–still conscious, barely being able to talk, but her entire body tensed up and standing still, especially her feet and hands. They lasted around 10 minutes, and she’d feel sore afterwards. She’s been getting better, being happier as time passes and able to deal with things better. But just recently, when something that reminds her of traumatic experiences happened, she’d go in a “trance.” For example, I accidentally said something her ex would say, and she took it the wrong way, as if it was manipulative and blaming her for something I did. She started staring into nothingness. When trying to talk to her, she’d either not react, or barely say anything. When trying to touch her, she’d look very scared and pull away, telling me not to touch her. When asking her to tell me my name, she’d say her ex’s name. When doing nothing, she’d just stare into nothing, staying still. When getting too close, she’d react rashly to get away and tell me to stay away. After a while of trying to snap her out of it, she’d walk away into another room, often the bedroom. Last time, she went to the washing machine, then the bedroom, and told me to stop asking her what my name was, that I always do that, even though it was the first time during that “trance” that I asked. So she’s at least minimally aware of her surroundings, and the trances may be connected? During those four times, she was unconscious, seemed extremely traumatized, and thought I was her ex. It lasts 15-20 minutes. She snaps back (once after I made her say my actual name a few times, another after I kept telling her I loved her she shed a tear and snap back, the last one after she fell asleep for a couple of minutes) and doesn’t remember anything whatsoever. She feels empty, but in an okay mood, like nothing happened. I’d like to now what’s happening, and if it’s dangerous in any way. Thanks for your time.\nAnalyze the text for cognitive distortions.

It seems like a really bad habit, but now I’m not sure if it’s just a habit. I have a lot of interests. I like researching and finding out what I like, but that also happens to be a bad thing since when I find an interest and I decide to pursue it, after little time, I give up on it. I don’t know why, but I always seem to do it. It’s like I lose interest, or whatever motivation I had in the first place. For example, a couple of weeks ago I had decided to write a book. I’ve always loved writing and reading, even when I was younger. Reading is certainly an addiction, while writing fills me with satisfaction. So I started creating the plot and organizing the story, because I wanted to do it perfectly. I started making summaries per chapter so that when I actually start to write, I know what goes on in the chapter. I was so pumped about it. I felt like this time, I was going to do it right. Until a few days ago. The book was just by the half. I stopped logging in my computer. I stopped looking for words. I stopped having interest. I simply stopped wanting to write. And I know that it’s not writers block, because I knew what I had to write, I just didn’t want to. And I’m so annoyed about it, because I was telling myself at the beginning: “Don’t worry, you’ll totally make it through the end this time.” And once again, I’ve failed to complete it. And not just in writing, I also quit tap dancing, piano lessons, TV shows, you name it. And I’m disgusted by this because I want to finish stuff, but then I don’t. I’ve never been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorders, but I’m pretty certain I have them. I’ve never checked myself because my parents have enough troubles on their own. I have also insulin resistance and tachycardia (they are aware), so I don’t want to trouble them with something as big as depression and anxiety that may just be all up in my head and possibly not be true. I just keep everything inside, and wait until it all goes away. Please help me.\nAnalyze the text for cognitive distortions.

And not with guns or anything like that either. I want to slice them open with a knife, taste their raw flesh, and watch the light leave their eyes as they die. If people on the street knew what I was thinking about doing to them, then they’d probably be horrified. Fantasizing about this sort of of thing really arouses me sexually, and while it’s not the only thing that does, it’s possibly the best. These urges don’t only occur when I’m upset or angered, but those emotions definitely amplify them. For example, if I’m just standing there with something sharp in my hand, I’ll have the impulse to just thrust it into the soft throat of the nearest person. I would just love to feel it sink in, and get covered by the blood gushing from their wound. I’d probably cannibalize their body, too, because I love the smell and taste of blood. When I was younger, I would cut my arms just to taste the blood and rub it on my face. I’ve never actually killed anyone, no matter how much I’ve wanted to, but I a did stab my neighbor’s dog to death once. It just made me feel so alive, like nothing else ever had, to feel it’s fear and watch it die.

Before I turned 10, my childhood was good and I have fond memories of my family hanging out / doing activities together. However, after reaching the age of 10, my father just stopped bothering to spend time with his children. Over the years he acts like he wants to hang out but when time rolls around for the activity to take place, always comes up with excuse to not hang out (be it family activities or spending time with individual family members). This obviously hurt my feelings as a child (mainly because I would try to follow things up) and he would always get angry at me. I’m now a 29 year old adult, and he still claims to want to hang out from time to time. However I really don’t believe him and get annoyed with this behavior because I know he won’t follow through. Problem I have, is not that he won’t hang out. If he doesn’t value his family enough to spend time with them, that’s fine. But he acts like everyone else is to blame for this (even though he suggests hanging out, and other people have to follow up to see if event is really taking place).\nAnalyze the text for cognitive distortions.

In his teenage years, he started to withdraw. I was the only one to whom he kept talking. He began to spend most of the day in his bedroom. He also began to use monosyllable words to reply to my parents, aunts, cousins… Never started a conversation unless you addressed him. Now, at 19 (almost 20), it has evolved to the point he doesn’t talk to anybody, not even to me, and not even with monosyllables. He doesn’t look anybody in the face either (he didn’t do that a few years ago). If I try to talk to him, he ignores me or makes a sound of annoyance and kicks me out of his bedroom. He is very childish too, in the sense that it is part of his routine to watch cartoons with his favorite stuffed toys (he refuses to throw toys away). He prefers their company to that of people. I don’t even know if he has friends. He certainly avoids his college peers. He has dinner alone and goes to sleep early (I bet it is only to avoid us too). He only goes out if he needs to get a book in the library or if he has to go to college. Otherwise, you’ll find him home. Is he afraid to become an adult? Could that be the reason he behaves like a child despite being almost 20? Could he have social anxiety? Autism, even? Maybe Aspergers. Some symptoms coincide: • Difficulty to socialize and make friends; isolation • Rigid routines (he gets distressed if he can’t follow them) • Fear of change (he doesn’t want to throw old/broken things away) • Hygiene issues (he rarely showers and shaves and he never uses deodorant) • Sensitivity to noises and light • Repetitive motor mannerisms (which he didn’t have as a child) If he had autism, though, he would have some speech difficulties, wouldn’t he? He actually uses sarcasm and understands it perfectly. Never shown any speech delay either. Besides, I think I read someone is born autistic, so he can’t become autistic at the age of 18. It’s been an evolution, that’s why I’m not sure what is going on. Is he just a very immature teenager or does he have a condition? (From Spain)\nAnalyze the text for cognitive distortions.

Last semester, I was having a hard time dealing with stress and loneliness and my own behavior started to scare me. Whenever I was alone –which was the case very often- I would keep talking to myself or singing. When I forced myself to stop, it just went on in my head and got really tiring. So I decided to go to the psychological consultation offered at my university. The first appointment was very helpful because I really needed someone to tell me whether I was going crazy. The psychologist told me it was my choice whether I wanted to come again or not, and we set an appointment for a month later. Back then, I thought it was a good idea to give myself the feeling that I was seeking help and also to feel a bit encouraged/“pressured” to follow his advice before the next time. Since I was no longer in that hysterical state, the second session felt a bit unnecessary. I don’t like it when I keep complaining to others (although very often I feel that I need to do so) and of course I admitted that I was feeling a lot better. Nonetheless, I agreed to have a third session another 2 months later, so that I wouldn’t be “all on my own” from then on. However, the thought keeps bothering me that I am just seeking attention. In fact, it makes me feel super-attention-seeking, just writing that. I used to be a good student at school, and now this kind of recognition is missing at the university. I keep involving myself in voluntary work, but the only reason it makes me happy is that it gives me acknowledgement from others. When I go to a doctor (which I rarely do) now I somehow enjoy being the center of attention. And that really bothers me.\nAnalyze the text for cognitive distortions.

I dropped out of college in May due to stress that inhibited me from functioning for months after (to this day I’m still trying to get my life back), after months of persistent mood swings, anxiety, and mild psychosis I went to see a psychiatrist in September (I think) that completely dismissed my concerns by saying I had “mild depression and terrible coping skills”;despite me mentioning I’d attempted suicide over 4 times!; which subsequently sent me into a severe depressive episode after the session. My mood never really lifted, and in November, 2 days before my birthday, I broke up with my boyfriend of over a year. The experience in itself was gut-wrenching and the week following even more so. I had a really bad breakdown one night, broke a bunch of things, wanted to kill myself but blacked out before I could do any damage. I figured things would only get worse until the next week when my mood did a complete 180 and I suddenly knew the answers to life, the fact my ex wasn’t talking to me no longer bothered me, I spent over $200 in 2 days (and the rest throughout the following week) etc. etc. (insert various symptoms of mania here).

Out of NOWHERE, I started constantly thinking about & plotting ways to spend time with a man approx 15 yrs younger than I. He works evenings & nights as a security guard where I reside. He’s been working here for approx. 6 mos. I’d seen & even spoken briefly to him several times previously, but without a hint of warning I became “closer” (no physical exchanges due to my faith & beliefs). Here’s the kicker: he couldn’t be FURTHER from what has always been my “type”. Where I live there are many different nationalities & people from many diverse ethnic backgrounds. I’ve always been attracted first & foremost, by physical appearance & to races other than mine (Caucasian). This “young man” is Hispanic, having only arrived in Hawaii last year, and is pure WHITE, skinny, shaved head, big ears & a horrible physique. Now’s the time to add the fact of my extremely good, rare physical shape-not only for “my age” but for women in general. I’ve had 5 large babies but have always been very athletic-serious weight-lifting for many years as well as running, canoe-paddling etc. In 2009 I realized my 35-year dream & underwent an abdominoplasty which removed 2 lbs. of loose skin only-no liposuction needed-& complete abdominal muscle restoration (stretch marks & scars are history & I’ve had extensive tattooing over the surgical scars. People think I’m “fibbing” when they learn about my large family because my body definitely is not the “norm” in the many-children dept. I’m 5′ 2″, still somewhat muscular, have long, straight hair (in which I keep all traces of white from becoming obvious) & am feisty & energetic. I’m certainly not movie-star gorgeous but not too shabby for 61* So…what is up with my totally out-of-character attraction to this guy? He has a beautiful accent I call “Sprench” for Spanish/French because it sounds like a little of both. He’s been very kind & considerate but I think I’ve frightened him with my hyper, “dog-with-a-bone” personality. He’s separated from his wife, who’s in CA. I mean, if my kids ever knew about this they’d think I’d totally lost it. I have 2 bodybuilder sons & all my children are super attractive, as are their kids.

She was diagnosed with severe pms which causes her so much stress that she turns to drink (and goes on week long benders). This has been happening for over 17 years. She is currently 43. During this time she gets extremely violent with me and my father, has trashed our house many times and fought with anyone- neighbours, police, etc. We have always suspected that it was more than pms, she’s practically an alcoholic and her behaviour isn’t cyclical as you would suspect from pms. Over time, her mental health has been getting worse. She has been on less benders in this time, however she is never happy. She is constantly stressed- even though there is no stress to worry about. She doesn’t take jokes, and we all have to choose our words very carefully in day to day life to avoid her going off. She has two other daughters under the age of 7, both of which she does not mother like a normal mum does. There’s distance and not much love. She has odd behaviour, like going shopping for groceries every day and buying things we don’t need. She associates herself with people who drink a lot of alcohol, so that when my father refuses to buy her any more she has someone to go and drink with. My father and I are under the impression that she may have an undiagnosed mental disorder like bipolar or schizophrenia (along those lines) and because her condition seems to be worsening with time, i wanted to reach out for an opinion. My family can’t live like this anymore. It’s unfair on all of us, and her. She is convinced that her issue is pms, so it would be hard to convince her to get help without premise such as advice in this forum. the drink will kill her one day, unless she stops. We want to live a normal life and have her back to the way she once was, if this means appropriate treatment for a potentially undiagnosed mental disorder, then so be it.

Which ended in my father wanting to leave, but he didn’t because my mom begged him to stay. She told us that, and we (her children ) supposedly don’t know they fought. But as the months have gone by she has completely crumbled. She has many breakdowns on weekends when my father goes out. When she has these breakdowns, she talks in a really suicidal way. She tells us how she wants to die, how she feels guilty, how she wants things to go back, how she really just wants to disappear. She acts this way because since they fought, my father completely neglected my mom. He told her that she can’t love her anymore and that he can’t forgive her. So coming back to her breakdowns, it is really worrying to see her in that state, in which she cries for hours and hours until she calms down. As her children, who are young we can’t really do anything for her other than give her a shoulder. But it has gotten to a point where she cries whenever she is alone. We don’t know what to do anymore, because she has stopped eating or resting. My father’s harsh words towards her really don’t help her, because she still hopes he might love her one day. So we just are desperate, because we feel that hugging her is not enough to help her be happy again. So, I ask for advice because my mother’s condition really just gets worse as days go by. What can I do for her to help her move on and find happiness because it really has affected me a lot. I love her and want her to be healthy and happy, not to feel like every day is more pain.

I apologized right after we had dealt with my family and tried to talk but he didn’t want to. He said everything was fine. I offered we go home and he said he wanted to stay.

My boyfriend got really drunk and got into a fight with me because he wanted me to drive him to his friends (we were in the middle of the ocean). I tried hugging him to show I loved him and it was okay and to calm down but that just made it worse. He said I tried to smother him, broke up with me in front of my family, and forced my family to take him to a private beach where he waited for someone to pick him up. Once we both got back home a few days later we tried to talk but he told me that I never supported his mental health. I had no idea he felt this way, that episodes like this were so intense. He told me he had bipolar but he never talked about it. I was really involved in finding him a therapist and I was always there but he would tell me he just “needed to be quiet” and he was “okay.” I’m not sure what to do.

My father caught me three times and I promised that I would stop all three times, but somehow, I still couldn’t stop myself. It was my way of curbing my depressive episodes and the suicidal thoughts that never cease haunting me. However, when I try to explain depression to him to make him understand depression from my angle, my father refuses to understand. He keeps telling me that other people have it far worse than I do and I should appreciate it. How do I explain to him that it is not that I’m not grateful for my life, it’s that I have this monster in me that is telling me nothing is worth it no matter how good my life is? How do I let him know that I am only smoking because I couldn’t find any other way to curb these feelings? And believe me, I have tried to stop smoking, but when the thoughts come, nothing seems to matter more than to put those thoughts to a stop no matter what. And in my case, it is by smoking.

She sleeps a lot and is sad often. She doesn’t answer text messages from anybody, not friends or even family. I have spoken to her because I am concerned about her mental health, and she knows she is sick. She thinks that she has depression, as well as a disorder somewhere between social anxiety and avoidant personality disorder. But she just won’t see a doctor. I have set up appointments for her only to fail in getting her to go- she just refuses and makes up an excuse like ‘I’m feeling tired’ or ‘I’m busy’. The few times she has set up appointments have been the same- she just doesn’t go. When she’s physically sick she will go, but won’t tell the doctor about her mental health because she feels embarrassed and awkward to tell a stranger about it. I can’t afford to have a doctor come to her, and neither can my parents. Even my parents don’t seem that concerned about her, they just complain that she has no job, even though that’s the least of the problems and a mere symptom of her mental health issues. I just don’t know what to do. It’s also hard because she seems to be dependent on me as I’m the only social contact she really has. When I went away on holiday for a month, she complained to me that she missed me and I needed to come home. I want to be there for her but it is so draining to be the person that she depends on, especially because I’m not a doctor, and she is not receiving any therapy at all. When she comes on outings with me, I end up not enjoying myself because she gets very anxious and I feel that I need to mediate that all the time. I also suffer from social anxiety on a smaller level, and it’s stressful to wonder what people might be thinking, if they notice her dependency and us both being anxious, and because of this, I prefer going alone.

I’ve always had a slight fear of having schizophrenia, as I’ve studied mental illness since it’s been a very big part of my life. Recently, however, I feel those feelings have been slightly amplified due to the correlative nature between schizophrenia and marijuana usage displayed in medical and psychological studies. I’ve noticed myself becoming paranoid when under the influence (a common thing, I know). That paranoia usually subsides after I rest, along with the influence of the drug. That being said, I’ve been having some thoughts of being able to change the world. These thoughts occur heavily when I’m high, but also sometimes happen when I’m sober (only much less intense), and usually come in the form of being able to educate people about empathy and kindness (since I’m a teacher and an actor). I’ve also had moments where I try to empathize with people in order to understand what they’re thinking, and maybe even try to “read their thoughts” in order to better connect with them.

My mother-in-law talks about her to me all the time with no sympathy even though my husband and I have said things to her. In a few years my husband and I want to build a house and have my mother-in-law move in for financial reasons and because she is an older lady. But I know she will want the ex to come over and she will say she helped pay for the house so she can have whoever she wants over. Although my husband understands why I am upset, he and his mom both say I have issues and need to grow up. I am at a loss of what to do. Do I just get over it and if they have an affair I get a divorce? Or do I get over it and trust my husband that she is an ex and he doesn’t want anything to do with her?

His response is total silence (he refuses to investigate this new BPD thing) and has cut off any possibility to try to resolve this. Meanwhile ironically enough his abandonment of me over this is not imaginary. Left to my own devices I spend all my days since 1st of the year existing in a pattern of emotional turmoil I can’t take much longer. I alternate between feelings of inconsolable grief and abandonment into resentment and culminating in my anger exploding leaving horrible messages on his phone which increases the gap. If we had talked when this all began it would have never developed into the mega storm it is but now it has – he has made no effort to get insight into BPD – he has genuinely abandoned me. The anger eventually burns out leaving me numb then we start over again. Being ignored as though I don’t exist also fuels the flames. Suffice it to say that I don’t see a way out and I do not want to spend my life cycling between all these painful feelings. I want to be able to talk to him, acknowledge how a part of me knows the rage is wrong and help him understand the mechanics of BPD.

This always happens a week or two before I leave a girl. This time I don’t want to, I want to have a serious relationship. People are usually jealous that I have a multitude of girls wanting to be with me dating me etc. but it happens unintentionally and right now I just want to have 1 girl in my life. I sometimes cry about this because I don’t know what to do. Thank you in advance. (From Turkey)\nAnalyze the text for cognitive distortions.
